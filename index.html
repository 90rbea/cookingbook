         At its most basic, cooking means applying heat to food. 
          Whether the food is baked, fried, sautéed, boiled, or grilled, it's all cooking.
         Evidence suggests our ancestors began cooking over an open fire over 2 million years ago. 
         People still cook some foods over an open flame, in addition to using tools like microwaves, 
         toasters, and stovetops.

        In scientific terms, cooking is transferring energy from a heat source to the food. 
        It is as much about the ways ​heat changes the food as it is about the heat itself. 
        That's because heating food does more than just make it hotter.
